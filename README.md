# NICLA-003-Voice-Action🗣️
Make your project listen and respond to your voice! This project uses the built-in microphone of the Arduino Nicla Vision board to recognize simple voice commands like “HI” and “BYE.” When you say “HI,” the LED lights up — and when you say “BYE,” and it turns off — all powered by TinyML running directly on the board, with no cloud involved.
